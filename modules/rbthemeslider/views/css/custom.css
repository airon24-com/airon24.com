/*
You can type here custom CSS code, which will be loaded both on your admin and front-end pages. Please make sure to not override layout properties (positions and sizes), as they can interfere with the sliders built-in responsive functionality. Here are few example targets to help you get started:
*/

.rb-container { /* Slider container */

}

.rb-layers { /* Layers wrapper */ 

}

.rb-3d-box div { /* Sides of 3D transition objects */ 

}

.rb-v6 .rb-bottom-nav-wrapper {
    top: -50px;
    left: 100px;
}

.rb-bottom-nav-wrapper, .rb-below-thumbnails {
    height: 0;
    position: relative;
    text-align: left;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
